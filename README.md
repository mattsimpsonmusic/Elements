# Elements

Elements is an interactive iOS-based application designed to improve the overall wellbeing of the end user through changing their relationship with technology. It incorporates advanced audio functionality and the use of immersive human-computer interaction to achieve this.

The functionality of Elements is comprised of three main features:

Breathe - An audio-visual experience designed for calm and relaxation.
Focus - A gamified task management system designed for productivity.
Reflect - An informal, simple mood-based self-assessment mode designed for emotional understanding.

The current version of Elements is a fully developed prototype of the final product, which provides an impression of how each mode will operate in the final model.
